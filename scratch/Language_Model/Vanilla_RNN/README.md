This is totally based on <a href="https://github.com/dennybritz/rnn-tutorial-rnnlm">dennybritz/rnn-tutorial-rnnlm</a> and <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/">wildml</a>

I just modified it a little for my own studying
